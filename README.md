# StudyBud – Project Story  

## Inspiration  
Finding a study partner can be challenging, especially in a new academic environment. Before university, I had peers to ask questions and study with, making learning easier. However, transitioning to university meant navigating courses and materials alone, making it harder to connect with people or form study groups. Many students face the same challenge and it is almost everyone's first year experience.

Additionally, my experience in **HLTH 102** this semester introduced me to many campus resources that I wouldn’t have known existed. The professor provided direct links to various student services, making it easy to access them and looking back they are all resources that i wouldnt have come across

## What StudyBud does
StudyBud is a **peer-to-peer academic support platform** that solves two main problems:  
1. **Finding a Study Partner** – Students can post and browse study requests based on subject and availability, making it easier to connect.  
2. **Accessing University Resources** – StudyBud centralizes important student resources into one categorized and searchable platform.  

## How I Built It  
### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Next.js  
- **Backend:** Django  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Languages:** Python and Javascrispt  
- **Deployment:**  Heroku for backend and Vercel for frontend
  - **Frontend:** [StudyBud on Vercel](https://study-bud-seven.vercel.app/)  
  - **Backend:** [StudyBud API on Heroku](https://studybud-b6d2e1c031ed.herokuapp.com/api/) 
  - **Github Repo** [https://github.com/kilas-Aniso/StudyBud.git)   

## Challenges I Ran Into  
- **Deploying the backend to Heroku** – Faced issues with **PostgreSQL migrations**, but successfully debugged and deployed the backend.  
- **Time Constraints** – Completing a full-stack project in **24 hours** as a **solo participant** was a challenge, but I stayed focused on delivering an MVP.  

## Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of  
- **My First Hackathon** – Competing solo and managing the full-stack development process.  
- **Building a Functional MVP in 24 Hours** – From ideation to deployment, I successfully created a working platform.  

## What I Learned  
I have learned that there is so much potential in us, but it only comes out when we are challenged to do big things within a short amount of time. Looking back, I am truly impressed by what I have been able to accomplish in just 24 hours.

## What's Next for StudyBud  
If given more time, I hope to continue working on StudyBud and implement:  
- **Bring this idea to life** - I believe StudyBud has the potential to be an essential **student tool** at Queen’s University.
- **Full Authentication System** – Ensuring only **Queen’s University students** can access the StudyBuddy feature.  
- **Real-time Chat Feature** – Allowing students to message their study partners directly instead of using email.
