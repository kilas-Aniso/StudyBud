# StudyBud

## Overview

University life can be overwhelming, especially for new students trying to navigate resources and find study groups. StudyBud is designed to solve two major challenges students face at Queenâ€™s University:

- The difficulty of finding study partners for peer learning and collaboration.
- The frustration of searching for university resources without knowing where to start.

StudyBud centralizes academic and student resources while making it easier for students to connect with study partners.

## The Problem

### 1. Finding a Study Partner
Many students, especially first-years, find it difficult to connect with peers for studying or even making friends. Peer-to-peer learning is a highly effective way to understand complex concepts, yet students often struggle to find a study group or partner despite their desire to collaborate.

### 2. Accessing University Resources
Queenâ€™s University offers a wide range of resources, but students often face challenges in discovering them. The information is scattered across multiple platforms and takes time for one to get exposed to all of them.

## The Solution

StudyBud is a platform that:

- Connects students with study partners based on their courses and availability.
- Centralizes Queenâ€™s University resources into an easily searchable and categorized platform.
- Reduces the time spent searching for help, whether academic, mental health, extracurricular, or career-related.

## Features

### StudyBuddy
- Students can post study requests specifying their subject, availability, and a brief description.
- Peers can browse study requests and express interest in connecting.
- Contact details are displayed to facilitate easy communication.

### University Resources
- A categorized directory of key student resources at Queenâ€™s University.
- A search function that allows students to quickly find what they need.
- Tags for easy filtering of resources.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Heroku (Backend)

## Future Improvements

If given more time beyond the 24-hour hackathon, I would expand the project to include:

- A full authentication system to ensure only Queenâ€™s University students can access the StudyBuddy feature.
- A real-time chatbot for instant messaging between study buddies instead of conversation via email.
